/* Question no. 4(b):
 * This program finds the minimum number of roads that need to be traversed to collect all packages
 * within a distance of 2 and return to the starting location.
 * The number of locations, package availability, and road connections is parsed to read input
 * Any node with a package is a valid start to find a starting location.
 * BFS is used to traverse roads:
 * At first moved to adjacent nodes.
 * Then collected packages in reachable nodes.
 * Then tracked roads traveled (counting multiple passes).
 * After that returned to the starting location:
 * Then ensured the shortest route back using BFS.
 * Finally Output is the total number of roads traversed.
